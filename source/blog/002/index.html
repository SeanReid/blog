<h1 class='post-title'>TDD is MAGIC</h1>
<section class='post-content'><p>To keep some sort of structure in this blog I thought I would start with
  telling a little about me and then a little about TIYA. Yes, I already feel trained to think of organizing
  while creating. I’m not sure if that goes in the about me or the about TIYA. :)

Prior to coming to TIYA I have watched Youtube videos and done countless online tutorials. My “experience”
prior to day 1 is minimal. I have created a Flashlight Android app, just changes the screen color and has a
button to change it. Created with code and not using the UI to drag/drop. A Tic/Tac/Toe game that I watched
many Youtube videos to make and essentially just get told what to do. I can tell you neither were much of a
learning experience. I do have a BSCS specializing in network security. It has not helped me get a job I want
nor many interviews. It’s that empty experience section on my resume that is holding me back. I had one class
near the end of my degree program that was C++, the programming bug bit me. I was hooked but wasn’t a degree
program that would have steered me towards programming. Funny that my capstone project was a blackjack game.
It took a full semester, with a team, to make a bad blackjack game. TIYA 2 weeks to make a bad blackjack game.
I’m guessing that won’t be a headline for any blog post they use… But, I think I am the only one who didn’t
finish. Last thing to mention about my experience is I have lots of experience in applying for jobs and being
told they are looking for more experience. So, according to employers looking for “junior” developers I am not
of the junior level. The question always seems to be, “what have you done?” The answer is truly I have created
nothing.

I mentioned week 1 and 2 is a blur but I do have a ton more knowledge than I have is all the online free
tutorials I have completed. I’m not bashing the online resources I have used just reiterating that the immersion
I am getting is simply better for learning. My big AHA so far this week is TDD. My design with the blackjack
game was make lots of objects, methods/classes, and make them all fit. I know blackjack and have a bit
of a mental flowchart of what the game should look like, what could go wrong? Turns out everything was and went
wrong. TDD FTW! It is like magic we did the bowling game kata and watched Uncle Bob do it in Java.
Red/Green/Refactor by the end of this some how I had a bowling score game. There was just start with I know
I need a game so lets make a test to force that code. Now this isn’t a speedy process for me on my first TDD
task… But, it was so amazing that you just think of the next test and everything else comes together. I really
tested for all strikes and thought, “how can I make this work?” The test passed?!? TDD is MAGIC!
