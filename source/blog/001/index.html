<section class='post-content'><p>My first blog post ever! My name is Sean and today is the day I start blogging
  my journey through The Iron Yard Academy. I am hoping that this will serve as a journal of my weekly thoughts,
  challenges, victories and progress. I hope this also is inspiring others to take action on their dreams. I
  have spent years wanting to drop everything and learn to code but always had an excuse/reason of why not.

I have been itching dreaming of being a full time developer for a long time. Creating something is just one
part of my inspiration to become a developer. Not many people wake up to a job they want or even in a field
they want. I know that has been my journey in life thus far! I don’t want these blog posts to be incredibly
long and I also don’t want to hit you with my life/career story all on entry one. So, we will get back to my
story another time. For now what’s happening at TIYA?!

Code immersion! It feels like somedays I get it and the next…

It’s a struggle EVERYDAY! I’m not saying this is bad at all. Coming into
this I expected the most intense learning pace. I’ll say it again, code immersion! I rarely am doing anything
besides something to do with code. Eat/sleep/code sounds hard and it sounds crazy… It’s also awesome, I really
try to spend as much time as I can doing something to hone my skills.

Week 1 and 2 are really a blur, I have learned tons. It’s been almost entirely Ruby up to this point. Week 2
project was a console blackjack game. It proved to be nearly all Friday, Saturday and Sunday to get it about
90% completed. Best effort is what the aim is for now. I am hoping to come back to it with later learn skills
to be much more efficient. Eat/sleep/code isn’t really my story so far. What I’m doing it’s code/code/code.
When I’m eating I am watching a tutorial, keynote or reading something! When I’m sleeping I’m dreaming about
code. No really! Samantha, my wife, can attest to that. I have an 11 month old daughter, Kennedy, who rarely
makes it through the night without needing something. So, last night Samantha asked me to get a diaper,
TEAMWORK! Being in that just barely awake 1am frame of mind she tells me I asked her, “what card she needed?”
Hilarious! Dreaming of code is real! I did get her the diaper but never found out about what card she wanted.
