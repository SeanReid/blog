<section class='post-content'><p>My first blog post ever! My name is Sean and today is the day I start blogging
  my journey through The Iron Yard Academy. I am hoping that this will serve as a journal of my weekly thoughts,
  challenges, victories and progress. I hope this also is inspiring others to take action on their dreams. I
  have spent years wanting to drop everything and learn to code but always had an excuse/reason of why not.

I have been itching dreaming of being a full time developer for a long time. Creating something is just one
part of my inspiration to become a developer. Not many people wake up to a job they want or even in a field
they want. I know that has been my journey in life thus far! I don’t want these blog posts to be incredibly
long and I also don’t want to hit you with my life/career story all on entry one. So, we will get back to my
story another time. For now what’s happening at TIYA?!

Code immersion! It feels like somedays I get it and the next…

It’s a struggle EVERYDAY! I’m not saying this is bad at all. Coming into
this I expected the most intense learning pace. I’ll say it again, code immersion! I rarely am doing anything
besides something to do with code. Eat/sleep/code sounds hard and it sounds crazy… It’s also awesome, I really
try to spend as much time as I can doing something to hone my skills.

Week 1 and 2 are really a blur, I have learned tons. It’s been almost entirely Ruby up to this point. Week 2
project was a console blackjack game. It proved to be nearly all Friday, Saturday and Sunday to get it about
90% completed. Best effort is what the aim is for now. I am hoping to come back to it with later learn skills
to be much more efficient. Eat/sleep/code isn’t really my story so far. What I’m doing it’s code/code/code.
When I’m eating I am watching a tutorial, keynote or reading something! When I’m sleeping I’m dreaming about
code. No really! Samantha, my wife, can attest to that. I have an 11 month old daughter, Kennedy, who rarely
makes it through the night without needing something. So, last night Samantha asked me to get a diaper,
TEAMWORK! Being in that just barely awake 1am frame of mind she tells me I asked her, “what card she needed?”
Hilarious! Dreaming of code is real! I did get her the diaper but never found out about what card she wanted.
————————————————

You&rsquo;re in! Nice. We&rsquo;ve put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost
editor and get you started. Go ahead and edit this post to get going and learn
how it all works!</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Writing in markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply
write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>formatting</em>
shortcuts to style your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two

<ul>
<li>A nested item</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk</li>
<li>Drink the milk</li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like
<a href="http://ghost.org/">http://ghost.org</a> - it&rsquo;ll automatically be linked up. But
if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here&rsquo;s a link to
<a href="http://ghost.org/">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h2>What about Images?</h2>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your
article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img alt="The Ghost Logo" src="http://tryghost.org/ghost.png" /></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That&rsquo;s ok too. Leave yourself a
descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the
image in to upload:</p>

<h2>Quoting</h2>

<p>Sometimes a link isn&rsquo;t enough, you want to quote someone on what they&rsquo;ve said.
It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future
release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it&rsquo;s definitely a word.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wisdomous - it&rsquo;s definitely a word.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Working with Code</h2>

<p>Got a streak of geek? We&rsquo;ve got you covered there, too. You can write inline
<code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more
comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>
<div class="highlight plaintext"><table style="border-spacing: 0"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl" style="text-align: right"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
4</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>awesome-thing {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<h2>Ready for a Break?</h2>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a fancy new
divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain
old HTML and it&rsquo;ll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!"></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you
think :)</p>
